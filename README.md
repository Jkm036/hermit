# Hermit

A website that is built using Angular that serves as a purpose to connect users with different communities of interest. Every user will be allowed to create, like, and interact with posts throughout the website and communities. In addition, Hermit will allow users to connect with others through community specific voice servers and channels.

Currently the website is still in production, so many functionalities may or may not be working as expected.
